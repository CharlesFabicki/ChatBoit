# Simple Chatbot using Python and Tkinter

This is a simple chatbot application implemented using Python's `tkinter` library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and the `sklearn` library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Overview

This chatbot interacts with users, responding to their input based on a predefined set of prompts and responses. It utilizes the `CountVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB` classes from the `sklearn` library to handle text classification tasks. The graphical user interface is built using the `tkinter` library, providing a user-friendly way to communicate with the chatbot.
